          'In Indian classical music, a **swar** (स्वर) is a single musical note — the most fundamental unit of melody. The word comes from Sanskrit and literally means "that which shines by itself." Unlike Western music which uses the letters A through G, Indian music names its seven notes **Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni**. These seven notes form a complete musical universe from which all melodies, raags, and compositions arise.\n\nThe concept of swar goes beyond mere pitch. Each swar carries an emotional character, a specific aesthetic quality called **rasa**. Ancient texts describe Sa as evoking steadfastness, Re as excitement, Ga as joy, and so on. When you play a note on your bansuri, you are not just producing a frequency — you are invoking a mood.',

        title: 'The One Teevra Swar',
        content:
          'In Indian classical music, **teevra** (तीव्र) means "sharp" or "intense." While komal lowers a note, teevra raises it. However, unlike the komal system which has four notes, only **one** swar can be made teevra: **Ma (Madhyam)**.\n\n**Teevra Ma** is raised by one semitone above its shuddha position. On a C-key bansuri, Shuddha Ma = F, and Teevra Ma = F# (F-sharp). This single alteration has a profound impact — Teevra Ma creates a bright, uplifting, yearning quality that defines some of the most beloved raags in Indian music.\n\nWhy only Ma? The system of 12 semitones in an octave means that each swar "occupies" certain chromatic positions. Lowering Re, Ga, Dha, Ni by a semitone and raising Ma by a semitone covers all 12 chromatic notes: Sa, komal Re, shuddha Re, komal Ga, shuddha Ga, shuddha Ma, teevra Ma, Pa, komal Dha, shuddha Dha, komal Ni, shuddha Ni.',

          'Consistent, structured practice is far more effective than sporadic, aimless playing. A well-designed practice routine ensures you develop all aspects of bansuri playing — tone, technique, theory, and musicality — in a balanced way. Even 30 minutes of focused, structured practice yields better results than 2 hours of unfocused noodling.\n\nThe key principles of effective practice:\n• **Daily consistency** over duration — 30 minutes every day beats 3 hours once a week\n• **Deliberate practice** — focus on what\'s hard, not what\'s comfortable\n• **Progressive difficulty** — gradually increase challenge as each level becomes easy\n• **Active listening** — record yourself and listen critically',
